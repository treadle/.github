## What it does

This demo app allows you to import your wallet.

Equip with NFT bikes, make a trip, and get an award in the form of $SCRW fungible tokens.

Wait for the energy recovery, energy soul-bound fungible token, and go again on the road.

During the trip, you can see the speed, the mileage that was driven on the bike, the number of tokens earned, etc.

While waiting for power to be restored, you can admire your bikes or count the number of zeros in the token balance.
